			<h2> Why we should be concerned </h2>
			<p id="whyConcern"> We should all be concerned since all forms of bullying can greatly affect a person's life, well-being, self-esteem,
			and mental health. We should not downplay the seriousness of cyberbullying and its harmful effects on a person. With the internet becoming
			more accessible to people, cyberbullying has become more common, and more and more people are affected. Children and teenagers are often targets of it,
			and it can lead to serious consequences on their overall health. No one deserves to be bullied, abused, and harassed. </p>
