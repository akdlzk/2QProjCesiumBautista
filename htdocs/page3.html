		<h1 class="pageTitle"> Harmful Effects of Cyberbullying </h1>

		<section>
			<p> Cyberbullying leads to devastating and long-lasting effects on one's well-being. It has the ability to damage one's physical, emotional, and mental health. When someone experiences cyberbullying, they may feel stressed, anxious, upset, and afraid most of the time. It can affect their mood, self-esteem, confidence, appetite, emotions, and outlook on everyday life. Cyberbullying can make things worse when the victim is already going through a hard time. </p>

			<p id="whyDifferent"> Cyberbullying is similar to other forms of bullying, such as physical bullying, verbal bullying, and traditional bullying often found in schools. But what makes it different and possibly more harmful than them? The thing is that cyberbullying takes place on the internet, which is a vast network that connects almost everybody around the globe. It can take place at any time of the day, unlike traditional bullying (at school) that usually takes place during school hours. Plus, one can be anonymous on the internet. There is more freedom for bullies to bully someone online since they can keep their identities hidden. It is harder to get caught by parents and other people. There is an increased tendency of the victims and bullies to hide these kinds of incidents from parents, family, and friends. It makes cyberbullying harder to resolve, prevent, and identify. On the internet, there is a wide range of ways to harass someone, which includes bullying through online pictures, phone calls, text messages, comments on social media, video calls, live online games, and others. The bullies may not be with the victim in person, yet their actions toward the victim can be crueler than real-world bullying. Now, with all these, here are some of the damaging effects and consequences of cyberbullying:</p>

		<section class="subSection">

			<section class="effects">
				<h2> Low self-esteem and confidence </h2>
				<p> Cyberbullying greatly impacts one's self-esteem and confidence. Victims may start to feel bad and frustrated about their appearance or specific traits that they have. Cyberbullying can make victims feel bad about themselves. They may start to belittle and undervalue themselves and have feelings of doubt about their worth. </p>
			</section>

			<section class="effects">
				<h2> Changes in behavior </h2>
				<p> As cyberbullying continues, one's behavior may start to change, and these behavioral changes can indicate cyberbullying. These changes include: </p>

				<ul>
					<li> Loss of interest in hobbies and daily activities they usually enjoy </li>
					<li> Isolation and spending less time with family and friends </li>
					<li> Becoming sadder and quieter than usual </li>
					<li> Appearing upset or angry while browsing the internet and going online </li>
					<li> Sudden secretive behavior </li>
					<li> Skipping school </li>
					<li> Drug and alcohol use </li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section class="effects">
				<h2> Performance in school </h2>
				<p> Cyberbullying affects a person's academic performance. Victims may start to lose interest in school or be absent frequently. They may avoid their peers and have feelings of embarrassment. Their grades and scores on tests can be affected as well. Dealing with cyberbullying can make it more difficult to concentrate and focus, and thus it can affect one's studies. </p>
			</section>

			<section class="effects">
				<h2> Depression and anxiety </h2>
				<p> Cyberbullying can cause victims to become anxious and feel depressed. It can lead to mental health issues and higher levels of stress. Victims may start to feel hopeless and afraid. Feelings of sadness, despair, anger, and frustration are factors of anxiety and depression. With the stress and negative feelings they experience from being bullied, victims may harm themselves and have suicidal thoughts. They may do these as ways to lessen and respond to the pain they go through. </p>
			</section>

			<section class="effects">
				<h2> Physical health </h2>
				<img src="../images/How to talk about cyberbullying.jpg" id="page3image2">
				<p id="physicalHealth"> Cyberbullying causes feelings of anxiety, stress, and worry. Having to deal with bullying can affect one physically. It damages one's physical health, and it can lead to issues like changes in sleep schedule. It can cause disturbances and alter sleeping patterns and habits. Victims may experience insomnia, have nightmares, or sleep more (or less) than usual. Another effect would be about eating habits. Being in a constant state of stress and worry can change the eating habits of people. They may skip meals or eat more than usual. It can lead to eating disorders too. Aside from these, there are other effects in terms of physical health, such as abdominal pain, headaches, nausea, and diarrhea. </p>

			<section class="effects">
				<h2> Emotions, feelings, and perspective on life </h2>
				<img src="../images/Depressed teen photo.jpg" id="page3image3" class="imgFloatRight">
				<p id="emotions"> Cyberbullying causes great stress, and aside from the stress, victims feel sad, hurt, embarrassed, humiliated, and afraid for their safety. It can become difficult to relax, be at ease, and feel safe. Victims may feel that the situation is not going to be better and that there is no escape. Victims can feel alone and isolated from everyone and think that no one can help them. They may also be angry and frustrated at themselves and the bullies. All these negative emotions can impact one's perspective and attitude on life. Targets of bullying may become unmotivated, be scared, lack self-confidence, and feel doubtful. In other words, cyberbullying, like other forms of bullying, inflicts emotional damage and leaves deep emotional scars. </p>
