			<h2> Cyberbullying around the world and in the Phillipines </h2>
			<img src="../images/Industrial-Internet-of-Things.jpg" id="page2image1">
			<p id="internetImpact"> The Internet has succeeded in connecting people around the globe, and now, we practically live online in the digital world. We now enjoy convenient communication and more comfortable living. The rise of technology brought us achievements, benefits, and lots of good things, yet it also has consequences and harmful effects. It impacted and changed our lives for both the better and worse. It gave rise to problems and threats, with one of these being cyberbullying. It has become a widespread problem, and it continued to spread with the rise of the Internet. </p>

			<br>

			<p> A poll conducted by UNICEF in June 2019 revealed that nearly 75% of children and teens from 30 different countries responded that cyberbullying is most common in social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. </p>

			<p> Today, cyberbullying is still prevalent around the world, and it is no different in our country, the Philippines. According to the National Baseline Survey on Violence Against Children (NBS-VAC, 2016), nearly half of Filipino children ages 13-17 are affected by online bullying. This is alarming, considering that children and adolescents today have increased access to social media and the Internet. It is saddening that young people are the primary targets of it. According to UNICEF, verbal abuse through the Internet accounts for a third of the cyberbullying and violence experienced by young Filipinos. Sexual messages and content account for a fourth of it, and it includes leaking someone's nudes on the Internet. According to Statista research, CALABARZON, or region 4A, experienced the most cyberbullying incidents in 2019, with almost 92,000 victims, and it is followed by CARAGA and NCR, respectively. </p>

			<h2> Cyberbullying during the pandemic </h2>
			<p id="pandemic"> Currently, we are going through a pandemic and living in the new normal. Our country and the rest of the world have implemented online classes to continue education amid the pandemic. We have stayed at home most of the time, and our way of communicating with others is through virtual means. Our way of continuing classes is through the Internet. This has increased young people's use and access to different applications and social media sites. With these, the time spent online increased, yet there are notable risks. Due to the pandemic, cyberbullying, harassment, and hate speech have increased drastically. There has been a rise of inappropriate comments towards people, and some go too far by sending death threats towards someone. Applications and meeting platforms like Zoom have been intruded on by hackers to disrupt meetings and send hateful remarks. It can be said that the Internet has become a more toxic and dangerous place since the start of the pandemic. According to Verywell, other factors play a role in the sudden increase of cyberbullying, and these include boredom, isolation from peers, lack of supervision, more freedom in Internet use, feelings of stress, and other psychological reasons. </p>
